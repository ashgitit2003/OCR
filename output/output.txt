Dehradun: —_ Hyderabad-
based National Geophysical
Research Institute (NGRD, a
research laboratory of Coun-
cilof Scientificand Industri-
al Research (CSIR), in its 43-
page report on Joshimath
subsidence, has claimed that
certain areas of the town
“sunk vertically by over 3
feet and moved by 1.4 feet”.
The NGRI wasamong the
eight specialised scientific
and technical institutions
mandated to ascertain the
causesof ground subsidence
in the area in and around
Joshimath and carry out re-
medial measures. The re-
port, which was kept ‘secret’
by the state government for
months and made public on-
ly recently, pointed to “steep,

The report pointed to ‘steep,

air-filled fissures extensively

developed and extending to a
depth exceeding 100ft"

depth exceeding 100ft”.
It claimed: “The fissures
on barren and agricultural
land were as deepas li5ftand
become shallower and tan-
gential at 60-65ft depth to-
wards lower reaches of the
subsidence-hit town.”
“Maximum _ horizontal
displacement along the fis-
sures were observed in Su-
nil, Manohar Bagh and
Singhdhar with displace-

mentas high as 45cm (1.4ft).
Vertical displacement
(sinking) as high as 10-
10cm (3.6ft) was witnessed
in Singhdhar and Marwa-
ri,” the NGRI report said.

While carrying out a de-
tailedmappingof thecracks
on the ground, the NGRI sci-
entists found the fissures
were distributed from the
upper slopes of Sunil village
having an altitude of 2,200m
toMarwari-Jaypee region at
the toe of Joshimath slope,
situated at a height of
1,400m. NGRI experts said
“the fissures were mostly
confined to the gently slop-
ing built-up areas.”

An expert at Uttarak-
hand SDMA, requesting ano-
nymity, told TOI, “The fis-
sures extending up to over
100ft depth were found in ar-
eas having loose soil cover
and there wasno presence of
rocks beneath the surface.”
