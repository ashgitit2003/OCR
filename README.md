The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) project is designed to extract text from images efficiently and accurately using Python. It incorporates several technologies and libraries, such as Pytesseract, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and OpenCV, which are instrumental in processing and analyzing images. The project's core functionality revolves around converting image-based text into editable and searchable data. Key features of the project include advanced image preprocessing techniques—such as noise removal, binarization, and deskewing—to enhance the accuracy of text extraction. Additionally, the project utilizes the difflib library to compare extracted texts, helping identify similarities or duplications in the content. This functionality is particularly useful in applications where verifying the originality of the text or detecting unauthorized copies is required. The system is built to be robust and adaptable for various use cases, making it a valuable tool for any scenario involving the need to digitize printed or handwritten documents effectively.
